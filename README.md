# Included Encryption Methods
Symmetric ciphers:
AES, Blowfish, CAST, DES, 3DES, RC2, RC4, AES - Blowfish - 3DES

Asymmetric ciphers:
RSA

Extra encryption:
The library has also classes for socket encryption with Diffie Hellman, AES and RSA

# Encryption Classes
Symmetric encryption classes:
AES, Blowfish, CAST, DES, 3DES, RC2, RC4, AES - Blowfish - 3DES

All this classes can only encrypt and decrypt

Asymmetric ciphers:
RSA

This class can do the following:

Generate RSA keys

Import RSA keys from a file

Store RSA key with AES encryption in a file

Store the public key in a file

Encrypt only with RSA

Decrypt only with RSA

Encrypt with RSA and AES

Decrypt with RSA and AES

Encrypt a file with RSA and AES

Decrypt a file with RSA and AES

Sign data

Verify data

Sign a file

Verify a file

Show private an public key

# Socket Encryption Classes
Diffie Hellman and AES

RSA and AES (Server only)

RSA and AES (Client and Server)

RSA, AES and Diffie Hellman (Client and Server)
